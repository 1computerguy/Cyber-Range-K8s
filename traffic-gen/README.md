# Traffic Generation services

TODO: Add services for automated traffic generation in the network. Research various tools available and determine the best to integrate. Current, known options, listed below for research.
- Ostinato (stateless only)
- TRex (stateful and stateless, currently a Docker container, complicated configuration)
- Warp17 (stateful and stateless, Docker container out-of-date with mainline code, needs more research)
